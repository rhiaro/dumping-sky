The wind had stopped. It hadn't been this still in... well, a long time. It was hard to measure time on a planet with no seasons and inconsistent daylight. A planet that didn't even really have a name. Bechar's siblings called it Tunnae, but that was just a word from their ancestors' old tongue. It meant "home", but with a twist. Home that wasn't really home. Home that you had been away from for so long that it wasn't quite familiar when you got back. Home that you hadn't really settled into, but you were there and had nowhere else to go, so might as well make the best of it. Less "home", and more "here". More "this is where we are right now."

This was the only place Bechar had ever been. Bechar, like most people, didn't draw a distinction between the planet's surface and the chaotic orbital habitats. They were all part of Tunnae, neither comfortable or convenient, neither more or less "home" than the other, just part of life.

Bechar was crouched behind a rock, that might once have been a metal canister of some kind, but now was fully incorporated into the environment. The line between natural features and things that had been brought from elsewhere was very indistinct here. The only things that were for sure native were the himinies. Two long-limbed creatures in jetsuits with helmets that concealed their faces towered over one of the himinies a few strides from Bechar's position. The himinie was curled in a ball, which is what they typically did when threatened. Bechar's toes, plastic wrapped and insulated, curled into the cold mud beneath. Bechar's fists were balled tightly, every muscle tense. These beings must be offworlders, because nobody who called this planet Tunnae would treat a himinie this way.

Bechar wanted to intervene, but was still working on a strategy. The aggressors were at least three times Bechar's height, not that Bechar had much going in that department in the first place. And Bechar was.. not strong. Hiding, darting, slipping away. These were Bechar's strengths, and Bechar knew it well. It was a quiet time in an out-of-the-way spot. Nobody was likely to be passing by, on the ground or overhead, anytime soon. Bechar's backpack contained a handful of groundnuts, three large metal spoons (scavenged from the landscape earlier), and a single flare. Bechar contemplated the flare. It was probably just as likely to bring bad attention as help. With some strength and skill the sharp end of a spoon could definitely be purposed as a weapon, but Bechar had neither.

The tall beings stood as if they were in conversation with each other, but made no sound. This was common; their helmets would be transmitting audio between them on a private channel. Bechar _might_ be able to tap into the channel with the right equipment, and if the beings weren't being particularly careful. But the right equipment was back in the Den, and anyway, Bechar was still learning about that stuff. It would be helpful to know what they were planning to do with the himinie they had cornered. Bechar didn't know _how_ they had cornered the fuzzy little local, they were usually pretty hard to catch, and rarely alone. But there were all kinds of reasons for wanting to kidnap one. If you didn't know better.

As Bechar watched from hiding, one of the tall creatures extended a lengthy lower limb to poke at the heap on the ground, which didn't move. A heartbeat later, the ground beneath them swelled, then crumbled, and the tall creatures were suddenly buried up to their necks in dark silt. The himinie was gone altogether.

Bechar smirked. There were other himinies around after all. Small as they were, they could take care of themselves, and took care of their own.
