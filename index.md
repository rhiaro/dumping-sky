The wind had stopped. It hadn't been this still in... well, a long time. It was hard to measure time on a planet with no seasons and inconsistent daylight. A planet that didn't even really have a name. Bechar's siblings called it Tunnae, but that was just a word from their ancestors' old tongue. It meant "home", but with a twist. Home that wasn't really home. Home that you had been away from for so long that it wasn't quite familiar when you got back. Home that you hadn't really settled into, but you were there and had nowhere else to go, so might as well make the best of it. Less "home", and more "here". More "this is where we are right now."

This was the only place Bechar had ever been. Bechar, like most people, didn't draw a distinction between the planet's surface and the chaotic orbital habitats. They were all part of Tunnae, neither comfortable or convenient, neither more or less "home" than the other, just part of life.

Bechar was crouched behind a rock, that might once have been a metal canister of some kind, but now was fully incorporated into the environment. The line between natural features and things that had been brought from elsewhere was very indistinct here. The only things that were for sure native were the himinies. Two long-limbed creatures in jetsuits with helmets that concealed their faces towered over one of the himinies a few strides from Bechar's position. The himinie was curled in a ball, which is what they typically did when threatened. Bechar's toes, plastic wrapped and insulated, curled into the cold mud beneath. Bechar's fists were balled tightly, every muscle tense. These beings must be offworlders, because nobody who called this planet Tunnae would treat a himinie this way.

Bechar wanted to intervene, but was still working on a strategy. The aggressors were at least three times Bechar's height, not that Bechar had much going in that department in the first place. And Bechar was.. not strong. Hiding, darting, slipping away. These were Bechar's strengths, and Bechar knew it well. It was a quiet time in an out-of-the-way spot. Nobody was likely to be passing by, on the ground or overhead, anytime soon. Bechar's backpack contained a handful of groundnuts, three large metal spoons (scavenged from the landscape earlier), and a single flare. Bechar contemplated the flare. It was probably just as likely to bring bad attention as help. With some strength and skill the sharp end of a spoon could definitely be purposed as a weapon, but Bechar had neither.

The tall beings stood as if they were in conversation with each other, but made no sound. This was common; their helmets would be transmitting audio between them on a private channel. Bechar _might_ be able to tap into the channel with the right equipment, and if the beings weren't being particularly careful. But the right equipment was back in the Den, and anyway, Bechar was still learning about that stuff. It would be helpful to know what they were planning to do with the himinie they had cornered. Bechar didn't know _how_ they had cornered the fuzzy little local, they were usually pretty hard to catch, and rarely alone. But there were all kinds of reasons for wanting to kidnap one. If you didn't know better.

As Bechar watched from hiding, one of the tall creatures extended a lengthy lower limb to poke at the heap on the ground, which didn't move. A heartbeat later, the ground beneath them swelled, then crumbled, and the tall creatures were suddenly buried up to their necks in dark silt. The himinie was gone altogether.

Bechar smirked. There were other himinies around after all. Small as they were, they could take care of themselves, and took care of their own. Under the ground was the domain of the himinies. Their network of tunnels under the planet's surface was unmapped, at least as far as Bechar knew. They were a long way from a Supply Hub here, which was usually the only place the himinies surfaced to interact with the planet's other residents.

Bechar just watched as the helmeted beings struggled in the mud. Their suits would protect them from the cold, but they wouldn't be able to survive there forever. A jetsuit should work in the mud after a short exposure, and Bechar wondered why they didn't activate them. Probably they had someone, some shuttle or ground trolley, they could call for a rescue. Better to leave before someone else got here. As Bechar turned, intending to wriggle away without being seen, there came a grating, slurping sound, and a tremble in the ground. Bechar looked back in time to see the reflective tops of two helmets disappearing into the surface.

Bechar hurried away. Unstable patches of ground and sinking mud were common out near the wetlands, but not here. That was not a natural occurrence. Unless you subscribed to the belief that anything the himinies did was natural. The himinies had done this alright. There was no other explanation.

_Attention all citizens of the Surface!_

_A large deposit of wood - that's right, real wood from real trees - is dropping into a veeeery low orbit in about half a decaturn!_

_(That's five turns folks, just five turns from now.)_

_Pack your haulers, get your jetsuits on, hop in your shuttles, whatever it takes, because once it hits that atmosphere it's gone gone gone._

_The folks upstairs have decided it's not worth saving! But we passionately disagree. Your best launch point is gonna be to triangulate between toast bowl power, fire knee housing, and Supply Hub T7. Good luck!_

_You're listening to BKM Radio, for the realest updates from the Surface._

Maprush stood in line at the Supply Hub, wondering about Bechar's absence. Everyone else in the line was a little squirt of a child, doing their family duty.  Maprush towered over the tallest of them by a chest and a head. Bechar didn't make a habit of finding better things to do than pick up the food, but did have a habit of disappearing for several turns at a time and not checking a chronomark. The line shuffled forward. Kids passed by carrying backpacks or pulling suspended trolleys piled high with supplies, splitting off into every different direction as they left the Supply Hub from the other side. Maprush could not decide whether to be worried yet or not.

The temperature that day was weird. The drop in wind made it seem warmer than it usually was. Maprush had sleeves rolled up to elbows, exposing dark forearms, but hands remained clamped in sturdy polyfibre gloves. Maprush's hair, usually tightly wrapped under a scarf, was today bouncing free in a wild tangle. The unexpected calm was affecting everyone's mood, Maprush decided, so Bechar would be out of sorts as well.

Maprush stepped into the Supply Hub, the ambient temperature increasing just a little from heat transmitted through a deck of creaking metal panels. It was a nice change from cold mud underfoot. Mud that had been dragged in from outside was dried and cracking on the floor, filling the air with a hearty musty smell. The Supply Hub was a quiet space; any words uttered were whispers, and sounds from outside were muted by the curving padded and plastered walls. The himinies didn't like sudden movements or loud sounds, and respecting that was second nature to anyone on the surface of Tunnae.

This Supply Hub, like all others, was round, and the line that Maprush waited in curved in a spiral to the center. In the middle was a gentle slope to descend, and at the bottom of the slope two or three himinies waited. One person descended at a time. It was even warmer here, the metal deck became the ceiling, and the dried mud smell could sometimes be stifling.

When the time came, Maprush had to crouch to make eye contact with the himinie who was checking identities. Wide brown eyes met beady black ones that never blinked. Most himinies looked the same to non-himinies, even those who had lived all their lives on the surface. Himinies stooped as they stood and walked, so looked shorter in stature than they really were, but still were rarely taller than a child of any other species on Tunnae. Short, bristly fur covered their bodies, limbs and faces, in colours that ranged from inky blue, through all shades of mud, to the dark beige of wet sand. They had six limbs. Two feet planted firmly on the ground, when they were dealing with non-himinies at least, and two that hung loose, curled or dragging, with wide webbed claws. Their forearms, or legs, were smaller and more dexterous, but similarly webbed and clawed.

The himinie who looked into Maprush's eyes was remembering Maprush from every other encounter Maprush had ever had with any other himinie before. The himinie remembered that Maprush was part of a household of two, remembered Bechar, remembered how many decaturns worth of supplies Bechar had collected for them both last time, and that more than that amount of time had passed since then.

The himinie waved Maprush past, and another himinie watched closely as Maprush loaded up a backpack from low shelves, observing how much was taken. It wasn't much. Maprush would send Bechar back in a few decaturns for more.

Maprush finished packing, nodded thanks to the himinies, and ducked through a low opening to ascend another slope. This led upwards in a straight line this time, back to the surface a few strides from the back of the Supply Hub.

It was cooler now. Partly due to the contrast from the air inside the Supply Hub, but also because the widest part of the debris rings had moved overhead, filling the sky, blocking light from the already distant home stars. The debris rings brought their own light, uneven and metallic, reflections bouncing off haphazard surfaces in unnatural colours.

Maprush's mind wandered on the slow walk home. The light was distracting and comforting in equal measure. Shadows appeared to move and change, beckoning, twisting, and wandering through peripheral vision. Other surface dwellers passed by on the wide track between Port Dee and the Supply Hub, but nobody Maprush knew well. It was a track that had formed from use, not something constructed, the mud pounded down into a hard almost black clay. Footsteps and voices swirled in the air. A distant roar accompanied a plume of black smoke from a metal processing plant out east. A faint rattling whoosh was the signature sound of an unseen shuttle launch from one of the lower ring bays.

At home, Maprush put five decaturns worth of beans in the day-cooker. Maprush lived with Bechar in a place that was far too big for the two of them, but it wasn't long ago that this home had been full. The structure they inhabited was circular; the walls had once been a single engine housing from an enormous freighter. It was barely recognisable as such these days. The outside had faded, rusted, been splattered by mud storms, and overgrown by ground vines over the course of several generations. The inside had been stripped for parts, no doubt, as soon as it had cooled from whatever had brought it down, leaving a hollow shell.

Several dozen occupants had built up the interior so that by the time Maprush and siblings found the place they had a four storey structure to move into with a haphazard winding spiral stair through the middle to give access to each level.

The kitchen was on the ground floor, near the main entrance (which was a jagged gash in the metal where someone had wrenched it aside to make an opening) for easy evacuation of cooking fumes. Primarily they used an industrial stove, many times repaired, that would consume almost anything as fuel. The day-cooker was a recent addition that Bechar had won in a game of modified calaps up in the rings. Maprush appreciated being able t leave a large quantity of food to soak and stew for several turns without needing supervision and with minimal risk of setting everything on fire.

Since Bechar was nowhere to be found for now, it was a good opportunity to  go up to the rings and check on their upcoming calaps prospects. Bechar was the calaps genius, who played for fun. Maprush was the one who made it worthwhile. It had been many centaturns since this arrangement had begun, but Maprush always felt a little nervous about any encounter with _the provider_, Hon Saring.

At some point, Maprush would have to tell Bechar about it all. But not yet. Better to let Bechar have as much of an innocent childhood as anyone could, in a place like Tunnae.

Maprush set the intruder trap on the way out, and walked to the center of the settlement. The wind was still almost non-existant, and the mud underfoot was wetter than usual. A few people were about, but it was eerily quiet. Normally the array of chaotic improvised homes that made up Port Dee, spread far across the flat ground, were rattling and jingling, tinkling and chiming. Windmills and sails of all sizes, decorative and functional, spun and flapped. But without the wind, everything was still.

The elevator was in the approximate center of Port Dee. Maprush pressed into the space with several others, nodding at those with familiar faces (or helmets, or breathing masks), and waited, tuning out the safety instructions and countdown that played automatically. The elevator ascended, a quarter turn journey to the mid ring.

Mid ring twelfth segment - commonly known as _murts_ - was Maprush and Bechar's 'local' spot in the orbital debris. The _murts_ elevator station had been constructed with an open transparent dome around it. It was bright; no debris between it and any of the home stars for several turns at a time, sometimes longer. Pretty luxurious really. There were even pots with broad-leaved plants in strategic locations cared for by enterprising ring dwellers to make the most of the light.

Maprush crossed the open space under the dome, scarecely sparing a glance for surroundings, and took a direct route into a darker side corridor. _murts_, like most ring segments, was a maze of interconnecting tunnels, walkways and ladders. There were moving parts too, and sometimes you needed to pass through an airlock and take a very short shttle trip to get where you were going. For anyone comfortable in a spacesuit, there was a while different perspective on the debris rings to be had.

There was a lot more diversity among the lifeforms what chose a permanent residence up in orbit, too. The planet's surface was mostly the domain of the himinies and humanoids, and various smaller mammels. There were some exceptions. But species less tolerant of higher gravity and barely life-sustaining conditions tended to opt for the rings.

And folx came from all over, and ended up here for any number of different reasons. Usually it was better not to ask.

Maprush had to slow down to weave through a gaggle of insectoids - either kik ha'a or gemliptus, Maprush never could tell them apart - who were engaged in some kind of heated debate across a whole corridor. Hisses, whistles and clicks filled the air and the buzz of wings as some were in flight, but the group broke and flowed around as Maprush passed through.

Maprush turned a corner and had to duck as two celeian orbs zipped by overhead. A little way on, a hubot - more bot than hu- by the outward appearance - walked arm in arm between two exceptionally tall and lanky red tonoans. Their long necks arched their heads forward in front of the rest of their bodies and their limbs curled in on themselves to take up as little of the restricted space as possible.

A ladder led down what might once have been a vent in an explorer starship and opened out to a moderately sized space with walls composed primiarly of hundreds of old cryostasis pods.

Maprush had to let go of the ladder and drop the rest of the way to the floor. The floor, too, was stasis pods, and curved and slippery underfoot. A challenge for most small-footed bipedal beings, but Maprush knew to make contact with the highest part of each pod domb where possible, and avoid slipping down the curved sides to the gaps between. Low gravity helped too with lightly stepping from pod to pod.

The place was filled with a diverse and elaborate array of seating arrangements and tables, many of which were occpied.

Maprush glide-hopped to a bar that was designed for beings of a humanoid size and shape. Stools were attached to the side of the bar, not in contact with the uneven floor, and all of them were empty. Maprush sat.

The counter in front of Maprush blinked a green ready light.

Maprush braced. Reached a long finger forward, and tapped at the slightly glossy surface. Barely visible inputs glowed and emitted a very soft vibration under a gentle pressure. Maprush had used the ordinary unremarkable counter menu system to request a spice seppin, a punchy bubbling drink that was usually served in a tall glass with chewey algae balls bobbing around in it.

No drink came, but a slender, cloaked figure appeared seemingly from nowhere by the wall at the far end of the counter. Maprush sighed, slipped off the seat, and followed the figure through a gap in the wall. The domed cover of a stasis pod slipped back into place behind them with a hiss.

_I've gotta make this stop,_ Maprush thought for the millionth and first time. But the hold of Hon Saring was too powerful. Maprush tried not to think about the specifics.

The figure's head was hooded and face covered by a smooth matt black helmet. No words were uttered, but Maprush knew it was Tosha Gove, a humanoid from the third or second planet in the Mua Langu system. The helmet contained breathing apparatus; the atmosphere on Tunnae did not suit everyone.

Tosha Gove led Maprush down a stark corridor, lit with a clinically white light, a sharp contrast to the dim and warm tones of the bar. Tosha Gove was wearing hard-soled boots which clatted on the metal floor. As they approached the end of the corridor, distant shouting voices echoed.

Tosha Gove pressed a wide, webbed palm to a panel in the wall and a door slid open. Maprush passed through, feeling the light tingle of a weapon scanner.

Hon Saring sat on a suspended platform in the middle of the room, eyes closed, emitting a gentle hum. The platform was almost at Maprush's shoulder height Maprush focussed on clearing the mind of all but neutral passive thoughts. Capeoids like Hon Saring were sensitive to moods and emotions. Some could pick up on specific thoughts and tell apart truth and lies. Hon Saring was not so trained, but didn't say anything to dispel suspicions of those who let stories of mind readers and future tellers from the Savelon systems shape their perceptions.

There was an incense burning somewhere out of sight. The nutty, bitter aroma made Maprush's nostrils twitch. Maprush knew this was another part of Hon Saring's attempt to cultivate an air of mystery, because capeoids had no sense of smell or taste themselves.

_A team of seventy five delegates from around Celastana will be setting out tomorrow for the eighteen month trip to Mua Langu V. There, they will meet similar parties from some two hundred and twenty four occupied systems around the galaxy. Now eighteen months may seem like a long time for a trip, but many of these will have travelled far further than our lucky representatives, and some using inferior technology. This event has been more than ten years in the making!_

_Indeed Celastana, as the figurehead of the five planets in our Puhap solar system, will be one of the most advanced teams at the conference._

_Tune in later tonight for detailed profiles of every single one of our seventy five ambassadors. Find out how they were chosen, and what they are bringing to the table._

_Prime City Evening News, d203 of Final Quarter, 16701__

Ma'Solloqay trudged along the sand, thinking about the names given to things retrospectively. Decads or centads after the fact. Someone somewhere decided to call a great event the Battle of Five Elms, or a certain era the Time of the Reigning Sails. The things that happened were condensed, simplified, reshaped to fit the name. Ma wondered what people of the future would call the time now, and the time after. After would be something like.. something with _union_ or _alliance_. If everything worked out like it was supposed to.

The thing is, Ma'Solloqay never intended to go into politics. Ma was an historian. Ma couldn't help but look back on things from the future, even a future that hadn't happened yet.

Waves rolled in tenderly to Ma's left. The sand underfoot was soft and damp, dusty yellow swirled with lines of black. Ma skirted around the occasional patches of grey and red pebbles, bare feet feeling too delicate to stand pressure of even the smoothest of stones. There was seaweed too, in odorous tangles.

The sun was setting, and offered it's final bursts of warmth from an orange sky. Ma's face turned towards it. The last day under this sun. The last day until whatever future historians would call _after_.

Sea birds called and from the distance came the sound of a child laughing, distorted by the air and rocks between. Besides the sea, no other sounds. Ma enjoyed, for a moment, the feeling of time being frozen. This world was perfect.

It had taken generations of work to make it so. It was the only world in the system that was entirely perfect. Others had pollution, deprivation, unfriendly climates. Pockets of problems amidst their idyllic majorities. It helped that Celastana was small and stable of course but that wasn't enough to eradicate all challenges of a populated planet. The rest had taken work. And unity. The others in the system were on track to join them. All worlds were in this together, they helped each other out. But Celastana had got there first. That's why the Celastana delegation was the one going to Mua Langu V to meet representatives from almost every other populated system in the galaxy.

Ma found it strange that even small contingents from the other four planets in Puhap system were not coming along too. Nothing had been stipulated about delegations hailing from only one origin world per system, but the decision had been made early on in the planning, with fast agreement from all of the various other governments.

Celastana was the only planet with a completely unified population and single government though. Maybe that was it.

Ma'Solloqay was a deputy of a deputy, a glorified secretary really. And yet, was someone deemed important enough to be included on this trip. Ma was well liked in the Office of Statistics and Representation; an efficient worker with an easy smile and an almost photographic memory for numbers and figures.

People knew they could count on Ma.

Ma hoped they wouldn't change their minds after spending eighteen months cooped up on an intersystem liner.

Ma was also redundancy. This was no secret. Space was moderately dangerous, and anything could happen in a year and a half. Ma swallowed a ball of nerves at the thought. It was done, everything was planned, and there was no backing out now. Not that Ma wanted to back out... but eighteen months in space?

The furthest Ma had been to date, other than the quick couple of hour shuttle hop to Celastana's closest moon, was Perapanata. The sibling planet was three days away on commercial transit, and Ma had taken the trip as a school child.

Ma felt a little pang of guilt at having not been back since, because that was where the technology for Ma's arms had been developed. Ma remembered the time spent their fondly. The young Ma had been the center of attention, doted on, beloved by local and systemwide media alike as the first recipient of a new kind of myoneural prostheses. The technology was commonplace now of course, and even at the time it had not been revolutionary - just an iteration - but people liked to celebrate science with abandon here. That had been more than fifty Puhap standard years ago.

Ma looked down, flexing fingers that were the same texture as natural skin, though with a slight metallic sheen to the dark blue-black that was more common on Celastana. The silvering effect was optional, not inherant to the prosthetics. Most people opted for their prosthetic additions to be indistinguishable from the limbs they might have been born with. At one time Ma preferred to blend in, but in later years, during an upgrade, had chosen on the spur of the moment to take a very small eccentric liberty and stand out. Though in reality, the difference was barely noticeable. But Ma knew.

"_Metac_, where were you?" demanded Teak as Bechar came scrambling down the corrugated tube that served as the entrance to their den.

Bechar was immediately set upon by Buthorn, a four-limbed creature with shaggy grey fur and an enormous wagging tail. Buthorn pawed at Bechar's chest, tongue lolling, drool clinging to whiskers, and emitted a happy gurgling sound.

"Down little monster, down," Bechar murmured, mussing Buthorn's fur, encouraging the mudhound back to the ground.

"Maprush was in here looking for you," Teak pressed, swivelling on a hover chair to face Bechar. "Something about not having any beans left."

"Ah, detritus," Bechar cursed. "I shoulda gone to the Shub today. Too late now, probably." The Supply Hubs were always open, but Maprush would certainly have needed the beans several turns ago.

"Pick up anything good from the stacks?"

"No..." Bechar got a distant look. "Just these spoons. I got kind of... distracted."

"What's up?" Teak whizzed the hover chair over to where Bechar was slumped on a floor cushion and handed Bechar a steaming frothy cup.

"Thanks _metac_," Bechar sipped at the vaguely lilac foam. The drink was _bear_, made from the powdered tubers of one of the many native marsh plants cultivated by the himinies. It was hot and soothing, but also contained a stimulant. Bechar felt mind clouds begin to clear, and muscles relax.

Teak hovered, expectantly.

"There were some offworlders - by their look - they had a himini, balled up..."

"Just one?"

"Yeah, yeah, one, and they were poking with electro rods or something..."

"That's awful! Detritus and more detritus, _metac_, what did you do?"

"Nothing. I didn't know what to do. But something sucked them into the ground. They just disappeared."

"Ha! Himinies look out for their own."

"Yeah, but... What do you think happened? I've never seen that before."

"I heard about it, you know, from Conto out west. People, offworlders mostly, disappearing in the marsh all the time."

"No, no, this was different. It wasn't a sinkhole. I was out by the far stacks! Near that crashed shuttle, the one with red on the side. Mud out there is solid. It was like the ground crumbled away, then the whole filled right back up."

"Nah I mean it," Teak dropped the chair to almost the floor, down to Bechar's level. "It happens in solid parts of the marsh, where folk think it's safe and solid, I swear! Nothing like just sinking in wetlands. Disappear, nothing ever found. In sinkholes, usually you find something, some while later you know?"

Bechar shrugged, unimpressed by rumours from the west.

...

The game of modified calaps was one of psychology, memory, and pattern recognition. The mistake most people made was to see it primarily as a game of chance.

Bechar had learned how to play at a young age, from the oldest sibling Kento. There were many playing styles, and Bechar found it intuitive to quickly detect which was being used by any particular opponant. Teak was a moderately good opponent, only standing a chance against Bechar because they knew each other so well.

-------

Of those who weren't born on this planet, most came to get away from something. Most were driven there, and not interested in looking back. This, along with its distance from the next nearest inhabitable world (Mua Noxis VII) played a large part in why the place was so isolated.

The other thing that contributed was that Fauthstoquaite wanted it to be that way.

There had been a saying in Fauthstoquaite's family that all lost things found their way to Mua Noxis XII. They called it _petch_ though, which alluded to a hole, a dirty, smelly hole, the kind one wouldn't really want to fall into.

Fauthstoquaite preferred the galactic standard name, not least because Fauthstoquiate _had_ fallen down that hole, and not entirely by accident.

Most people in the Mua twin solar systems didn't spare a thought for the distance twelfth Noxis planet. Nobody was looking in, and nobody was looking out. It was the perfect place for a covert base of operations. And the fact that two solar systems - at least - jettisoned most of their unwanted _stuff_ in that direction meant that there was the tech to build anything, if you knew how.

Maprush met Fauthstoquaite for the first time while one of Bechar's more intense _calaps_ games was going on in the background. Bechar, as usual, was deeply absorbed and oblivious to all but the other players and the pieces on the table. Maprush was at the back of the room, negotiating, as it were, with a member of Hon Saring's entourage.

The right players had come to the table - that had been Maprush's responsibility for this job - but one of them didn't have the expected assets. Not Maprush's fault. Hon Saring's lackeys took care of the details like that. Which is why one such lackey was hissing aggressively at Maprush, pushing for a way to transfer the blame.

They stood side by side, both with backs against the wall, trying to keep their voices down and tones even so as not to disrupt the game as they argued. But this individual was a chonanoid: a surly, heavily muscled being whose thick green-grey skin literally bristled with anger. Most chonanoid species communicated primarily by smell, and this _metac_ reeked. Even Maprush, with a week humanoid olfactory system, was getting the message. And it couldn't be far from reaching the others in the room.

The chonanoid, whose name was Ish Tavash, was in the employ of Hon Saring for similar reasons to Maprush, though neither of them even spared a thought for the idea they might have anything in common. To Maprush, Ish Tavash was a looming bully, a stereotypical thick-headed henchperson who was looking for any excuse to beat someone up.

----

"I wonder if there's anyone else out there," Teak murmured to the sky.

It was a rare moment. A gap in the debris wide enough to cast true darkness, long enough to lay and look at distant stars. More than a dozen or so twinkled down at the pair.

Bechar looked sideways at Teak. "Of course there are, _tuppa_. Where do you think all the people *here* have come from? You know offworlders, right?"

Teak waved a dismissive three-fingered hand. "I mean beyond our home star system. Around those other stars."

Bechar frowned, but said nothing. Bechard had always assumed there were many such systems as their own. Sets of stars with sets of planets and a menagerie of occupants. Why shouldn't there be? Bechar had the distinct impression that most of the _calaps_ players in the rings were very far from local to their home stars. But nobody every talked about where they came from.

A memory surfaced of a long time before. Bechar hadn't been playing _calaps_, but watching Kento. It was maybe the first time ever Bechar had been on the elevator and up to mid ring. The memory of the feeling of newness and unfamiliarity washed over Bechar for a moment. It might be pleasant to feel that way again sometime.

The young Bechar, with no inhibitions about talking to strangers whatsoever, had been asking other _calaps_ players where they came from. At the time, Bechar supposed, the question referred to locations on Tunnae. Bechar's world at that point had recently extended from Port Dee to the western wetlands, so all manner of exciting possibilities were bubbling to the surface. But the responses ranged from cold to hostile. When Kento had realised what was going on, a gentle reprimand put an end to that line of enquiry.
