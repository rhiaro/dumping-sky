The wind had stopped. It hadn't been this still in... well, a long time. It was hard to measure time on a planet with no seasons and inconsistent daylight. A planet that didn't even really have a name. Bechar's siblings called it Tunnae, but that was just a word from their ancestors' old tongue. It meant "home", but with a twist. Home that wasn't really home. Home that you had been away from for so long that it wasn't quite familiar when you got back. Home that you hadn't really settled into, but you were there and had nowhere else to go, so might as well make the best of it. Less "home", and more "here". More "this is where we are right now."

This was the only place Bechar had ever been. Bechar, like most people, didn't draw a distinction between the planet's surface and the chaotic orbital habitats. They were all part of Tunnae, neither comfortable or convenient, neither more or less "home" than the other, just part of life.

Bechar was crouched behind a rock, that might once have been a metal canister of some kind, but now was fully incorporated into the environment. The line between natural features and things that had been brought from elsewhere was very indistinct here. The only things that were for sure native were the himinies. Two long-limbed creatures in jetsuits with helmets that concealed their faces towered over one of the himinies a few strides from Bechar's position. The himinie was curled in a ball, which is what they typically did when threatened. Bechar's toes, plastic wrapped and insulated, curled into the cold mud beneath. Bechar's fists were balled tightly, every muscle tense. These beings must be offworlders, because nobody who called this planet Tunnae would treat a himinie this way.

Bechar wanted to intervene, but was still working on a strategy. The aggressors were at least three times Bechar's height, not that Bechar had much going in that department in the first place. And Bechar was.. not strong. Hiding, darting, slipping away. These were Bechar's strengths, and Bechar knew it well. It was a quiet time in an out-of-the-way spot. Nobody was likely to be passing by, on the ground or overhead, anytime soon. Bechar's backpack contained a handful of groundnuts, three large metal spoons (scavenged from the landscape earlier), and a single flare. Bechar contemplated the flare. It was probably just as likely to bring bad attention as help. With some strength and skill the sharp end of a spoon could definitely be purposed as a weapon, but Bechar had neither.
