* one of the older sibs is still alive
* Map knows but B doesn't
* B thinks playing is for kicks but there's an element that concerns Map that is about K's safety
* We find out Map is up to something extra but don't know why for a while

* When F is in the picture, Map sees joining F as a chance to get more power that might help K
* Maybe F reveals knows something about this
* Map's blackmailer may seize on an opportunity when Map joins F to ask for spying. Map just tells f.

* F has a comms network outside of the system, something most Tunnae don't care/think about
* This is why F has a heads up on upcoming politics and tries to position self to be point of contact

Humanoids in this universe... not dominant, very spread out. But not the most looked down on either... Maybe inconsistent or unpredictable? Is that a trope?

Need something to foster kinship between Map and Ma. Maybe their languages are similar. The language of Map's ancestors is a dialect of Celastana's dominant native language. (But BKM have never heard of Celastana/Puhap etc)

An interesting controversy about how BKM's ancestors ended up on Tunnae... something Celastan did and covered up in their pursuit of perfection. Or an accident.

Need to meet other humanoids on Tunnae that know more/less about their ancestry/origins.
